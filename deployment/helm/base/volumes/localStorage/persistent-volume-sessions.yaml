# Example Persistent Volume declaration for the Skaha web service to use.  The labels to match on is configurable.  This is for LOCAL storage
# only for the services (i.e. running on a laptop), and will not be installed by default, but could be used on a new Cluster.
# In the values file for Skaha, the name of the PersistentVolumeClaim below will be referenced.
# This default will create a hostPath volume with no declared PV.
